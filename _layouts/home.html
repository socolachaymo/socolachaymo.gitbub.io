  <p>Hi everyone, my name is Thuy Nguyen. I am a first-year student at York University in Computer Science program. I found a passion for Computer Science two years ago
  and started learning about it on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera.org</a> and got a certificate of 
  <a href="https://coursera.org/share/4b3dfb6b82dbebbf6cee015fc1f7fb91">Python for Everybody Specialization</a>
  which is offered by the university of Michigan and includes courses:
  <ul>
    <li><a hrf="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python">Programming for Everybody</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python">Python Data Structures</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python">Using Python to Access Web Data</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python">Using Databases with Python</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization">Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python</a></li>
  </ul>
  I got another certificate of <a href="https://coursera.org/share/998fd2c6da4f10accfc7c576a779c18e">Algorithmic Toolbox course</a> by the university of
  California San Diego and <a href="https://coursera.org/share/26b9fa64ba2f2d9ab2f008a99193c1b3">Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals</a> 
  Then I had spent time to learn about Flask, Rest API and front-end related technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScipt). I also worked on some interesting 
  <a href="/projects">projects</a> to apply what I learned to practical problems. My projects include making games with pygame and creating apps using pyqt5.
  </p>
  <p>In my first semester at York University, I further developed my skills in math by taking courses in Differential Calculus and Discrete Mathematics, and 
    completed a team project to develop a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During my winter break, I learned about data visualization with 
    Pandas and Dash in Python, which I am working on developing further. In the second term, I am currently learning more about Linear Algebra, Integral Caculus and Programming in Java.
    During my leisure time, I like to work on personal projects and solving problems on <a href="HackerRank.com">HackerRank</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    My current goal is to get a summer co-op position to gain hands-on experience in the field, develop my skills and make valuable contributions to the organization I would work for.
